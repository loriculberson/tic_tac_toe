### Tic Tac Toe REPL game

**Works with Ruby version 2.3.1**

**To play**
1. clone the repo
2. cd into the tic-tac-toe directory
3. Type `ruby play_tic_tac_toe.rb` 

**To run RSpec tests**

Run the following specs separately:

1. `rspec spec/board_spec.rb`
2. `rspec spec/game_spec.rb`
3. `rspec spec/messages_spec.rb`
4. `rspec spec/player_spec.rb`

The `cli_spec.rb` is a work in progress and needs to be updated with the complete game flow from beginning to end. 

~Enjoy!
