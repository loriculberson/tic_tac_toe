### Tic Tac Toe REPL game

**To play**
1. clone the repo
2. cd into the tic-tac-toe directory
3. Type > `ruby play_tic_tac_toe.rb` 

**To run RSpec tests**
Run the following specs separately:
2. `rspec spec/board_spec.rb`
1. `rspec spec/game_spec.rb`
3. `rspec spec/messages_spec.rb`

The `cli_spec.rb` is a work in progress and needs to be updated with the complete game flow from beginning to end.
